# Querying data from Chicago datasets using SQL and Python
This notebook was the final exam for the Coursera-IBM course "Databases and SQLite for Data Science with Python". 
Here I built a database using SQLite and fed it three different datasets from the city of Chicago, CHICAGO_CENSUS_DATA, CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS, CHICAGO_CRIME_DATA. I then analysed the data using SQL and Python.
